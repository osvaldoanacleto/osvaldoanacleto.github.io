        	 <p>I completed my PhD in Statistics in 2012, supervised by <a href="http://statistics.open.ac.uk/People/catriona.queen">Catriona Queen</a> and <a href="http://statistics.open.ac.uk/People/p.h.garthwaite">Paul Garthwaite</a> at the <a href="http://www.open.ac.uk">Open University</a>. You can find <a href="Research.html">here</a>  an overview of the research I developed during my PhD.</p>		
<p>I have a BSc. and a Master degree in Statistics, both obtained at the <a href="http://www.ufscar.br">Federal University of S&atildeo Carlos</a>   (UFSCar - Brazil). While I was studying for both degrees, I worked under the supervision of <a href="http://www.icmc.usp.br/pessoas/professor.php?origem=sme&tipo=prof&id_pessoa=1011665&nat=sme"
>Francisco Louzada</a> on non parametric survival analysis.</p>

<p>Prior to coming to the UK in 2009, I worked as a temporary lecturer for UFSCar. In this post, I was responsible for devising and delivering statistics courses to undergraduate students from several areas and also a statistical inference course for Statistics students. While at UFSCar, I was also involved in some projects from a statistical consulting company.</p>

<p>I have also worked from 2005 to 2009 for Banco Ita&uacute (now Ita&uacute Unibanco) applying and developing a variety of statistical models to large financial datasets of bank customers, as well as supervising data analysts and providing statistical support and advice in the Research and Development Credit area.</p>
